Python GitHub Assignment- Module 13
Study Time Tracker

In this python assignment, I built a small Python program using the knowledge, skill and information gained throughout my university Python course. This program interacts with users, takes input, performs calculation and displayes the results based on the input acquired.
Throughout this project, I practiced creating a Git repository, adding multiple staged commits, pushing and syncing chnages and organizing the program using Git, Visual Studio Code and GitHub. I believe that this project was a good start to practicing a professional workflow in developing codes.

How to Run:

Open the folder and run:
python app.py
